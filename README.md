## 🏠 Problem Statement

Given various features (numerical, categorical, and textual) about residential homes, the task is to predict the final sale price. This is a **regression** problem. The dataset includes both training and testing splits, with various features including structural, neighborhood, condition, etc.

Key challenges include:

- Handling missing data in many features  
- Encoding and transforming categorical and ordinal variables  
- Feature interactions, derived features, and nonlinear relationships  
- Preventing overfitting and ensuring good generalization
